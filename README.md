What is two player sudoku?
- Two-Player Sudoku is a game in which two users can play Sudoku, each getting one turn at a time.
- It is broken down into 9 3x3 blocks with numbers 1-9 

Whenever an input is incorrect, users will be given an error message and then it will be the other player's turn 

To play the game, users must have Clion or Virtual Studio Code so the C++ file can be executed

This was created as a project to showcase progress in learning the C++ coding language

 Who created this project?
 - Isabel Ramirez and Gabriela Diaz
