# Vulnerability Reporting Process

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and encourage users and contributors to report any vulnerabilities or security issues they discover. Please follow the process below for reporting any potential vulnerabilities in the **Two-Player Sudoku** project.

### Public Vulnerability Reporting

To report a vulnerability publicly, please open an **issue** on our GitHub repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/isabelramirez10/Two-Player-Sudoku/issues). Make sure to provide as much information as possible about the issue to help us reproduce and resolve the problem efficiently. 

**Steps for reporting a public vulnerability:**
1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/isabelramirez10/Two-Player-Sudoku/issues).
2. Click on the **New issue** button.
3. Choose a relevant template (if available).
4. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any other relevant information.
5. Click **Submit new issue** to create the report.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

If you prefer to report a vulnerability privately (especially for sensitive issues), we encourage you to follow the steps below. We respect your privacy and will handle the information with care.

To report vulnerabilities privately, please email us directly at our project's security email

**Steps for reporting a private vulnerability:**
1. Send an email with details about the vulnerability.
2. Include all relevant information, such as:
   - The nature of the vulnerability
   - How to reproduce the issue
   - Any affected versions
   - Potential impact and scope
3. We will acknowledge the report and work with you to address the issue privately.
